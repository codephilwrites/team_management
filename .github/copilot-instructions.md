This project is a Vite + React + TypeScript SPA for team management. The app should:
- Use #016c42 as the primary color for a modern look.
- Allow managing value streams, tasks/notes, and 1:1 sessions.
- Use the File System Access API for persistent local data storage (not localStorage).
- Compile to static files and run as an SPA without a webserver.
- Resemble a task management/admin portal.
